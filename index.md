# 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to the *interactive PID control course** from UT Austin! This isn't just another set of lecture notes—it's a complete **hands-on learning laboratory** where you'll master PID control through **live coding, real-time experiments, and interactive problem-solving**.

## 🚀 What Makes This Special?

- **⚡ Live Python Code**: Write and execute PID controllers **directly in your browser**—no installation required!
- **📊 Instant Visualizations**: See control responses, tune parameters, and watch plots update in real-time
- **🧪 Interactive Experiments**: 5 hands-on exercises that let you **feel** how P, I, and D components work
- **🤖 AI-Powered Help**: Built-in chat assistant to answer your questions and debug your code
- **📱 Zero Setup**: Works on any device with a browser—tablets, laptops, Chromebooks, anything!

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this interactive course, you'll be able to:
- ✅ **Design and implement** discrete-time PID controllers in Python
- ✅ **Understand intuitively** how P, I, D components affect system behavior  
- ✅ **Apply professional tuning methods** (Ziegler-Nichols, manual tuning)
- ✅ **Handle real-world challenges** like saturation, noise, and disturbances
- ✅ **Analyze performance** with quantitative metrics (rise time, overshoot, settling time)
